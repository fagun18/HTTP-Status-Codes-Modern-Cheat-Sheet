# 307 Temporary Redirect

The request should be repeated with another URL, but future requests can still use the original URL.

### ℹ️ Details
The server sends this response to direct the client to get the requested resource at another URI with same method that was used in the prior request.

### 💡 Common Use Case
Use this instead of 302 when you want to ensure the HTTP method (e.g., POST) does not change to GET after the redirect.
