# 308 Permanent Redirect

The request and all future requests should be repeated using another URL.

### ℹ️ Details
This means that the resource is now permanently located at another URI. Like 307, this status code does not allow changing the HTTP Method.

### 💡 Common Use Case
Use this instead of 301 when you want to ensure the HTTP method (e.g., POST) does not change to GET after the redirect.

### 💻 Code Example
```http
HTTP/1.1 308 Permanent Redirect
Location: https://new-site.com/resource
```
