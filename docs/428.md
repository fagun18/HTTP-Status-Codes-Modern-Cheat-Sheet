# 428 Precondition Required

The origin server requires the request to be conditional.

### ℹ️ Details
The origin server requires the request to be conditional. This response is intended to prevent the "lost update" problem, where a client GETs a resource's state, modifies it, and PUTs it back to the server, when meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server, leading to a conflict.

### 💡 Common Use Case
API requiring If-Match headers for updates.

### 🔧 How to Fix / Handle
Add the required conditional headers (e.g. If-Match).
